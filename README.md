Introduction to Shiny apps for STAT/COMP 112

Goal: Create a Shiny app for my kids to explore the babynames dataset! 

Requirements: 

* Show the number of babies with a given name over time.  
* Allow the user to type a single name. (Ideally, it should give a message if there are no records of the name that was typed, but we won't worry about that now.)  
* Allow the user to choose a range of years. 
* Filter by sex.

Git test: I'm making a change in this file.
